# Decision Tree Specification #8 — Section 3.4 through 3.8

**File:** `Decision_Tree_Spec_Section_3_4_to_3_8_v1_1.md`  
**Purpose:** Defines the remaining five subsections of Section 3 (Technical Specifications)
for Decision Tree Specification #8. These sections cover: (3.4) how `TacticalContext`
instructions are translated into utility multipliers; (3.5) the execution dispatch
layer — the field-by-field population of `PassRequest` and `ShotRequest`, and the
`MovementCommand` construction for all five Agent Movement actions; (3.6) the
`PerceptionSnapshot` intake interface (`ReceiveSnapshot()`), resolving the interface
deferred by Perception System §4.5.3; (3.7) the four-state Decision Tree state machine
with full transition semantics; and (3.8) the edge case catalogue covering all
foreseeable abnormal decision conditions. Section 3.5 includes field-level
cross-references to Pass Mechanics §2.4.1, Shot Mechanics §2.4.1, and Agent Movement
§3.5.4. This file completes Section 3 of the Decision Tree specification.

## 3.4 Tactical Context Integration

### 3.4.1 Purpose and Scope

`TacticalContext` carries team tactical instructions into the Decision Tree pipeline.
At Stage 0, these are hardcoded defaults (§2.2.6 `Stage0Default()`). At Stage 1, the
Formation System populates real team-specific values.

The tactical integration step occurs in `ScoreOptions()` (§3.2) as a multiplicative
modifier applied to each candidate's `BaseUtility` after the attribute and context
multipliers. The sequencing is:

```
ScoredUtility = BaseUtility
              × AttributeMultiplier(...)
              × ContextMultiplier(...)
              × TacticalModifier(ActionType, TacticalContext)   ← this section
              × (1 − RiskPenalty)
```

`TacticalModifier` is always positive and non-zero. It may be less than 1.0 (suppressing
an action type), equal to 1.0 (neutral), or greater than 1.0 (boosting an action type).
It never drives a utility score to zero — that responsibility belongs to option
availability gates in `GenerateOptions()` (§3.1).

**Scope boundary:** Tactical modifiers adjust *how much* an action is favoured given team
instructions. They do not gate whether an action is available. An action not generated
by §3.1 cannot be rescued by a large tactical modifier. An action generated by §3.1 cannot
be suppressed to zero by a small tactical modifier.

### 3.4.2 Instruction-to-Utility Modification Table

The complete Stage 0 tactical modification matrix. All values are [GT] (gameplay-tuned).
All constants reside in `TacticalWeights.cs`. No inline literals.

Each cell shows the multiplier applied to `BaseUtility` for that action when that
instruction is active. Unlisted action-instruction combinations use a multiplier of
`1.0` (neutral).

**PressingMode modifiers** (applies to all agents regardless of possession):

| ActionType | PressingMode.HIGH | PressingMode.MEDIUM | PressingMode.LOW |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRESS | 1.4 [GT] | 1.0 | 0.6 [GT] |
| INTERCEPT | 1.2 [GT] | 1.0 | 0.9 [GT] |
| HOLD | 0.7 [GT] | 1.0 | 1.2 [GT] |
| PASS | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| SHOOT | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| DRIBBLE | 0.9 [GT] | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| MOVE_TO_POSITION | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |

**PassingStyle modifiers** (applies when agent has possession):

| ActionType | PassingStyle.DIRECT | PassingStyle.MIXED | PassingStyle.SHORT |
|---|---|---|---|
| PASS (long-range ≥ 20m) | 1.3 [GT] | 1.0 | 0.6 [GT] |
| PASS (short-range < 20m) | 0.9 [GT] | 1.0 | 1.3 [GT] |
| HOLD | 0.7 [GT] | 1.0 | 1.2 [GT] |
| DRIBBLE | 0.9 [GT] | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| SHOOT | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 |

Long/short range classification uses the same distance metric as `GenerateOptions()`
§3.1 pass candidate generation — `IntendedDistance` derived from
`PerceivedAgent.Position` relative to `AgentState.Position` at the time of scoring.

The PASS modifiers apply independently to each pass candidate in the scored list. A
DIRECT instruction does not uniformly boost all PASS candidates — it specifically
boosts long-range options and suppresses short ones, producing natural variation in
pass selection rather than a blanket bias.

### 3.4.3 PressingMode Multipliers

**Design rationale:**

`PressingMode.HIGH` is a manager instruction meaning "apply pressure to the ball
immediately." It increases PRESS and INTERCEPT utility, ensuring that agents within
`PRESS_TRIGGER_DISTANCE` (§3.2 §3.1) are more likely to select pressing actions over
HOLD or passive movement. The HOLD suppression (×0.7) prevents agents from being
comfortable sitting back when the team instruction demands aggression. The mild DRIBBLE
suppression (×0.9) reflects the football principle that a high-press team plays directly
and immediately — carrying the ball delays the collective press trigger and invites the
opponent to reset; the in-possession agent should release the ball quickly rather than
advance into contact.

`PressingMode.LOW` is the inverse: the manager wants shape retention over immediate
pressure. HOLD and passive movement are favoured; PRESS is suppressed to avoid agents
leaving formation to chase the ball.

At Stage 0, both teams use `PressingMode.MEDIUM` (`TacticalContext.Stage0Default()`).
The multipliers are defined and tested; they simply have no observable inter-team
difference until Stage 1.

**Implementation note:** `PressingMode` multipliers apply to all agents, whether they
have possession or not. A pressing instruction affects the entire team's disposition,
not just out-of-possession agents. The utility scoring context (`DecisionContext.HasPossession`)
already gates which actions are *available* — the tactical modifier operates on top of
the available set, not in place of availability gating.

---

### 3.4.4 PassingStyle Multipliers

**Design rationale:**

`PassingStyle.DIRECT` increases the utility of long passes relative to short ones,
producing a team that favours vertical progression and quick transitions. The HOLD
suppression (×0.7) prevents agents from dwelling on the ball when the team instruction
demands tempo.

`PassingStyle.SHORT` is the possession-football instruction: it boosts short passing
and ball retention (HOLD ×1.2) while discouraging long-range attempts that risk
dispossession. The DRIBBLE modifier remains neutral under all three styles at Stage 0
— individual dribble decisions are governed by `SpaceScore` and attribute multipliers,
not team passing philosophy.

**Long/short range threshold:** `PASS_LONG_SHORT_THRESHOLD = 20.0m` [GT]. This is
the only range-conditional tactical modifier at Stage 0. It uses the same distance
computation as option generation — no duplicate calculation is required.

```
// TacticalWeights.cs
// Controls: divides PassingStyle boost between short and long pass options.
// Effect of increasing: moving threshold up classifies more passes as "long" — 
//   DIRECT teams get more boosted candidates, SHORT teams get fewer boosted candidates.
// Safe tuning range: [12.0m, 30.0m] without structural formula changes.
public const float PASS_LONG_SHORT_THRESHOLD = 20.0f; // [GT]
```

### 3.4.5 DefensiveLineDepth Multipliers

`DefensiveLineDepth` is a continuous float [0.0–1.0] (§2.2.6) that controls how deep
or high the team's defensive line sits. At Stage 0 it is `0.5` (MEDIUM) for both teams.

`DefensiveLineDepth` does not modify utility scores directly. It modifies the
**target position** for `MOVE_TO_POSITION` option generation in §3.1: the formation
slot computed for a given agent is shifted upfield or downfield proportionally to
`DefensiveLineDepth`. The utility formula for `MOVE_TO_POSITION` depends on
`distance_to_formation_slot` (§3.2), which is derived from the adjusted slot position.

**Effect on utility:** A higher `DefensiveLineDepth` pushes formation slots upfield
for all players, making out-of-possession players urgently chase a forward defensive
position. A lower `DefensiveLineDepth` pulls slots toward the agent's own goal, making
deep defensive compactness the dominant movement directive.

```
// Formation slot vertical adjustment (applied in GenerateOptions §3.1, not here)
// DefensiveLineDepth = 0.0 → formation slot at 20% pitch depth (deepest line)
// DefensiveLineDepth = 0.5 → formation slot at 50% pitch depth (MEDIUM default)
// DefensiveLineDepth = 1.0 → formation slot at 80% pitch depth (highest line)
adjustedSlotY = baseSlotY + (DefensiveLineDepth - 0.5f) × DEFENSIVE_LINE_DEPTH_RANGE;
// DEFENSIVE_LINE_DEPTH_RANGE = 30.0m [GT] — full displacement range at extremes ±15m
```

`DEFENSIVE_LINE_DEPTH_RANGE = 30.0f` [GT]. Controls: the total pitch-depth range
over which the defensive line can be shifted. Effect of increasing: more dramatic
difference between deepest and highest line settings. Safe tuning range: [20.0m, 40.0m].

### 3.4.6 Possession-Phase Action Prioritisation

Tactical context modifiers interact with possession phase. The Decision Tree does not
apply possession-phase modifiers as a separate layer — they are already embedded in the
`BaseUtility` values and `ContextMultiplier` (§3.2). However, `TacticalContext` provides
one additional possession-conditional modifier:

When `DecisionContext.PossessionState == PossessionState.OPPONENT`:
- `PRESS` `TacticalModifier` is multiplied by an additional `PRESS_URGENCY_FACTOR = 1.2f`
  [GT] on top of the `PressingMode` multiplier.
- This is additive urgency: under opponent possession, all pressing instructions shift
  upward. HIGH pressing under opponent possession produces `1.4 × 1.2 = 1.68` effective
  multiplier; MEDIUM produces `1.0 × 1.2 = 1.2`; LOW produces `0.6 × 1.2 = 0.72`.

No other possession-conditional tactical modifier exists at Stage 0.

```
// TacticalWeights.cs
// Controls: extra urgency to press when team does not have possession.
// Effect of increasing: out-of-possession agents become significantly more
//   aggressive in pressing regardless of PressingMode setting.
// Safe tuning range: [1.0, 1.5] — above 1.5 creates unrealistic pressing saturation.
public const float PRESS_URGENCY_FACTOR = 1.2f; // [GT]
```
