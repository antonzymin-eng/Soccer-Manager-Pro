# CLAUDE.md — Tactical Director

> **Created:** March 26, 2026, 11:00 PM PST
> **Last Updated:** April 21, 2026
> **Purpose:** Authoritative rules for any AI agent (Claude Code, Claude chat, etc.) working on this project. Read this file completely before every task.

## PROJECT IDENTITY

**Tactical Director** is a football (soccer) simulation game targeting "Football Manager killer" ambitions. It follows a 10-year, 6-stage development plan. The project is solo-developed with AI assistance.

**Current phase:** Stage 0 — Physics Foundation. Writing 20 formal technical specifications. **No code exists yet. No code will be written until all 20 specs are approved.**

```

**Rules:**
- Each spec folder contains ONLY current-version files. No version suffixes in filenames. Git tracks history.
- `SPEC_INDEX.md` is the canonical source of truth for spec numbers, folder names, and approval status.
- `PROGRESS.md` is the canonical source of truth for schedule and milestone tracking.
- Never create files in `src/` during the specification phase.

**Claude Code indexing:** `docs/planning/` contains ~85K of master volume text that adds noise when working on individual specs. A `.claudeignore` file excludes this directory from automatic indexing.

**Deferred: `src/CLAUDE.md`** — Do NOT create until coding begins (after all 20 specs are approved). At that point it should cover: C# file naming conventions, constant catalogue file locations, Unity project structure, and build/test commands.

## CRITICAL DOMAIN CONVENTIONS

These conventions have caused bugs. Memorize them.

### Coordinate System

**Authoritative source:** Ball Physics Spec #1, §1.2 and Appendix C.

| Axis | Direction | Range | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|-------|
| X | Goal-to-goal (pitch length) | 0–105m | |
| Y | Touchline-to-touchline (pitch width) | 0–68m | |
| Z | Height (vertical, up) | 0m = ground | Ball center rests at 0.11m |

**Origin:** Corner of pitch (0, 0, 0) — NOT pitch center.

### Fatigue Convention

`0.0 = fully rested`, `1.0 = fully fatigued`. Any inversion is a critical error. This has been found inverted before (Pass Mechanics §2 FR-02, now fixed).

### Constant Tags

Every constant in every spec MUST have exactly one of these source tags:

| Tag | Meaning | Rule |
|-----|---------|------|
| `[GT]` | Gameplay-Tuned | Designer sets value; must live in tunable config |
| `[EST]` | Estimated | Placeholder; must be validated before implementation |
| `[FIXED]` | Fixed / physical law | Derived from physics; never tune |
| `[DERIVED]` | Derived from other constants | Formula must be documented; never set independently |
| `[CROSS]` | Cross-spec constant | Defined in another approved spec; consumed read-only here; never set independently in this spec. Citation must name the authoritative spec and section. Use `[CROSS]` only when the value is copied verbatim without modification — if a formula transforms it, tag the result `[DERIVED]`. |

Constants live in their designated `.cs` constant catalogues — no magic numbers in formula code.

### Parameter-Based Physics (No Type Enums)

The Decision Tree supplies physical intent parameters (velocity, spin, angle). Physics systems translate these into vectors. There are NO `KickType`, `ShotType`, or `PassType` enums in the physics layer.

### Heartbeat Tick Rate

Tactical/AI loop: **10 Hz** (100ms per tick). Physics/render loop: **60 Hz** (~16.67ms per frame). These are different loops. Do not conflate them.

### Interface Design Principle

**Write interfaces only when both sides are specified.** Do not create interfaces against unspecified systems. This avoids phantom interface proliferation (ERR-001, ERR-004).

---

## CROSS-REFERENCE SYSTEM

Specs use typed cross-reference IDs:

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `XC-` | Cross-spec reference | XC-001 |
| `FM-` | Formula reference | FM-003 |
| `EC-` | Edge case reference | EC-012 |
| `ERR-` | Spec Error Log entry | ERR-010 |

**KNOWN HAZARD — Spec Renumbering Cascades:** When any spec changes its canonical number, ALL cross-references across ALL files must be updated. This has been the single most recurring bug class in this project.

**KNOWN HAZARD — Stale Spec Numbers in Old Files:** Many files written before February 2026 contain wrong spec numbers from an earlier numbering scheme. A complete old-to-correct mapping is in `SPEC_INDEX.md` under "FORMER NUMBERING".

## SPEC FILE CONVENTIONS

### Template Structure (every spec follows this)

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| 1 | Introduction, scope, dependencies, key decisions |
| 2 | Functional requirements, data structures, failure modes |
| 3 | Core formulas, algorithms, pseudocode (subsections as needed) |
| 4 | Architecture, file layout, interface contracts |
| 5 | Test plan (unit + integration + validation scenarios) |
| 6 | Performance analysis and budgets |
| 7 | Future extensions and Stage 1+ deferrals |
| 8 | References, citations, DOI verification |
| 9 | Approval Checklist (quality gate) |
| Appendices | Derivations, verification tables, sensitivity analysis |

### Naming Inside Spec Folders

Files within a spec folder use descriptive names without version suffixes:

```
pass-mechanics/
├── outline.md
├── section-1.md
├── section-2.md
├── section-3-1.md          ← Subsections use hyphens
├── section-3-2.md
├── section-3-3-to-3-4.md   ← Grouped subsections
├── section-3-5-to-3-6.md
├── section-3-7-to-3-9.md
├── section-4.md
├── section-5.md
├── section-6.md
├── section-7.md
├── section-8.md
├── section-9-approval-checklist.md
├── appendices.md
└── audit-report.md          ← Comprehensive audit (if completed)
```

## AI BEHAVIORAL RULES

### Before Any Task

1. Read this entire `CLAUDE.md`.
2. Check `SPEC_INDEX.md` for current spec numbers and approval status.
3. If modifying a spec, read ALL files in that spec's folder first — not just the target file.
4. If the task involves cross-references, grep the entire `docs/specs/` tree for stale references before finishing.

### When Writing or Editing Specs

- Every constant must have a `[GT]`, `[EST]`, `[FIXED]`, `[DERIVED]`, or `[CROSS]` tag.
- Every formula must include units, valid input ranges, and at least one worked example.
- Never fabricate verification values in Approval Checklists. All values must be programmatically verifiable against source files.
- Append a version history entry to every modified file.
- Include creation date and purpose header on every new file.

### When Writing Code (Future — after all 20 specs approved)

- C# with Unity 2022 LTS conventions.
- Struct-based, zero-allocation architecture in the game loop.
- All constants in designated constant catalogue files — no magic numbers.
- Stage 0 uses `float`; Fixed64 migration is a Stage 5+ concern (Spec #9 will define the library).
- Deterministic replay is a hard requirement — no `System.Random`, no `DateTime.Now` in game logic.
- SplitMix64 for deterministic RNG. In Python tooling: omit `UL` suffix from C# constants; mask all intermediate multiplications with `& 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`.

### Things That Have Gone Wrong Before (Learn From History)

| Trap | What happened | Prevention |
|------|---------------|------------|
| Stale spec numbers | Decision Tree was #7 in ~75 places; canonical is #8 | Always check SPEC_INDEX.md |
| Fabricated checklist values | Approval Checklist claimed sections existed that were never written | Verify every checklist entry against actual files |
| Inverted fatigue | FR-02 said "1 = rested" — opposite of correct | 0 = rested, 1 = fatigued. Always. |
| Wrong coordinate origin | "Pitch center" comment in Agent Movement §3.5 | Corner-origin is authoritative (Ball Physics §1.2) |
| Phantom interfaces | Interfaces written against unspecified consumer systems | Only write interfaces when both sides are specified |
| Superseded file references | Approval checklist pointed to v1.2 when current was v1.3 | Git versioning eliminates this (no version suffixes) |

## OPEN ISSUES (as of April 22, 2026)

> **Keep this section current.** When resolving an issue, remove or update its entry here in the same commit.

- **Pass Mechanics (#5):** Approval SUSPENDED after March 25 audit (19 findings, all fixed). Awaiting lead developer re-review and re-sign-off.
- **Pending sign-offs:** Agent Movement (#2), Shot Mechanics (#6), Perception System (#7), Decision Tree (#8).
- **Perception System (#7):** Approval Checklist v1.5 written and all critical blockers resolved. Status: PENDING — awaiting lead developer sign-off. Checklist is in `docs/specs/perception-system/section-9-approval-checklist.md`.
- **Renumbering cascade outstanding:** ~49 stale spec-number references remain across Agent Movement (#2), Collision System (#3), and First Touch (#4) for Heading #9→#10, Goalkeeper #10→#11, and Fixed64 #8→#9. See `docs/tracking/fix-manifest-pass-mechanics.md` BROADER RENUMBERING ISSUE table.
- **Superseded files from old naming convention:** Must be removed during git migration — do NOT migrate these. See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete old-to-new mapping and FILE_MANIFEST pending removals.
