# src/CLAUDE.md — Tactical Director Coding Guide

> **Created:** May 19, 2026
> **Last Updated:** May 22, 2026 (v1.6 — adversarial review fix pass; 0H · 1M · 2L resolved)
> **Purpose:** Concrete coding rules for any AI agent or developer writing C# source code in this project. Covers file naming, constant catalogues, Unity project structure, and build/test commands. Cites Spec #20 (Code Standards & Style Guide) as the source for every convention here. Read the root `CLAUDE.md` first — this file supplements it, not replaces it.

---

## BEFORE YOU WRITE ANY CODE

1. Read the root `CLAUDE.md` completely.
2. Read Spec #20 (`docs/specs/code-standards/`) for the full rule set with rationale.
3. Read the `§4` (Architecture) file of the spec you are implementing.
4. Check `docs/specs/SPEC_INDEX.md` to confirm the spec's status is `APPROVED`.

**One folder per spec. One `.asmdef` per folder. Folder names match `docs/specs/` exactly.**

> **Note on `.asmdef` coverage:** Every spec folder listed above requires a
> `.asmdef` file (e.g., `pressing-ai/pressing-ai.asmdef`). Only a subset is shown
> in the tree for brevity. See each spec's `§4` (Architecture) file for the exact
> `.asmdef` reference list. GUIDs are blocked on Unity project initialization (see
> "WHAT IS NOT HERE YET").
>
> **Test assemblies:** Every `tests/` subfolder requires its own `.asmdef` with
> `testPlatforms: [EditMode]` (or as specified per Spec #19 §7.5 D2) and a reference
> to the parent spec's `.asmdef`. Test assemblies are excluded from production builds
> via platform filtering. Only the expanded spec folders in the tree above show the
> `.asmdef` entry; all `tests/` subfolders follow the same pattern.

### Assembly Layer Taxonomy

The authoritative layer taxonomy is Spec #20 §3.5.2. The three layers and their
members are reproduced here verbatim — do not infer layer membership from folder
order or spec number.

| Layer | Assemblies |
|---|---|
| **Physics** | ball-physics, agent-movement, collision-system, first-touch, pass-mechanics, shot-mechanics, heading-mechanics, goalkeeper-mechanics |
| **Mechanics** | positioning-ai, pressing-ai, defensive-ai, attacking-ai |
| **AI** | decision-tree, perception-system |
| **UI** | (Stage 1+ — not yet specified) |

The `deterministic-sim` and `event-system` assemblies are cross-cutting foundations
referenced by all layers (not members of any single layer).

The following assemblies are **infrastructure-only** and are NOT members of any
gameplay layer. Game-layer code (Physics / Mechanics / AI) MUST NOT import them
at runtime:

| Assembly | Role |
|---|---|
| `project-constants` | Constants shared across ≥ 2 spec assemblies; read-only by all |
| `performance-optimization` | Trace pipeline only (Spec #18 KD-3); no game-loop types |
| `testing-strategy` | CI orchestration tooling only (Spec #19); no game-loop types |
| `code-standards` | Governance only (Spec #20); no runtime types |

### Reference Direction

**AI depends on Mechanics. Mechanics depends on Physics. Never the reverse.**

```
project-constants  (read-only by all assemblies)

Physics  ←  Mechanics  ←  AI  ←  UI
```

`←` means "is referenced by" — `A ← B` means B depends on A (B imports from A).
The AI assembly imports types from Mechanics, which imports types from Physics.
A Physics assembly MUST NOT import from Mechanics or AI; a Mechanics assembly MUST NOT
import from AI. These prohibited import directions are enforced as build errors via
`.asmdef` reference declarations (FR-CS-046).

For upward event notification (e.g., a physics event consumed by AI), use a struct
event on the event bus — no direct assembly reference (FR-CS-047).

For the specific `.asmdef` references each assembly declares, read that spec's `§4`
(Architecture) file. Do not infer the intra-layer dependency chain from this document.

## BUILD AND TEST COMMANDS

> **Note:** The Unity LTS revision, backend (Mono/IL2CPP), and compiler flags are not yet pinned in `docs/tracking/certification-platform.md`. Fill those in before running the first certification gate (`FR-DS-009-GATE`). The commands below are the intended Stage 1 setup; update this section when the project is configured.

**Format check (pre-commit gate):**
```bash
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
```

**Build with warnings-as-errors:**
```bash
dotnet build /p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
dotnet test
```

**Unity batch-mode test run (CI):**
```
# To be filled in once Unity project is initialized and certification-platform.md is pinned.
```

**Stage 0 verification:** Manual code review against Spec #20 §5.4 checklist (7 categories, 73 FRs). Static analysis tooling (Roslyn analyzers, BannedSymbols.txt, `.editorconfig`) activates at Stage 1.

---

## FILE NAMING

- One public type per file. Filename must match the type name exactly (case-sensitive).
  - `BallState.cs` contains `public struct BallState`
  - `BallPhysicsConstants.cs` contains `public static class BallPhysicsConstants`
- Tests live in a sibling `tests/` folder under the same spec folder.
- No version suffixes in filenames. Git tracks history.

---

## NAMING CONVENTIONS

| Identifier | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Types, methods, properties, events | PascalCase | `BallState`, `ApplyKick` |
| Local variables, parameters | camelCase | `deltaTime`, `agentId` |
| Private instance fields | `_camelCase` | `_clock`, `_agentCount` |
| Private static fields | `s_camelCase` | `s_updateMarker`, `s_runTickMarker` |
| `[FIXED]` constants | `ALL_CAPS` | `BALL_RADIUS`, `DRAG_COEFFICIENT` |
| All other constants (`[GT]`, `[EST]`, `[DERIVED]`, `[CROSS]`) | PascalCase | `MaxSubsteps`, `TerminalVelocity` |
| Interfaces | `I` prefix + PascalCase | `IEventBus`, `ICollisionConsumer` |
| Assembly names / namespaces | `TacticalDirector.<SpecName>` | `TacticalDirector.BallPhysics` |

No Hungarian notation. No other prefix/suffix schemes (FR-CS-001/002).

**`var` policy (FR-CS-013):** Use `var` only when the type is immediately obvious from the RHS. `var state = new BallState()` is clear. `var result = Compute();` is not — write the explicit type.

---

## STYLE

**Indentation:** 4 spaces. Tabs are prohibited (FR-CS-011). Enforced by `.editorconfig` at Stage 1.

**Brace style:** Allman — opening brace on its own line (FR-CS-012).

```csharp
// COMPLIANT — FR-CS-012
public void Update(ref BallState state)
{
    if (state.IsGrounded)
    {
        ApplyFriction(ref state);
    }
}

// VIOLATION — K&R brace style
public void Update(ref BallState state) {
    if (state.IsGrounded) {
        ApplyFriction(ref state);
    }
}
```

**Explicit access modifiers:** Every type, method, property, field, and event declaration MUST carry an explicit access modifier. Relying on C#'s implicit `private` or `internal` is prohibited (FR-CS-014).

---

## NAMESPACES

One namespace per assembly. Sub-folders do not introduce sub-namespaces (FR-CS-007).

```csharp
// File: src/ball-physics/simulation/DragIntegrator.cs
namespace TacticalDirector.BallPhysics   // flat — no sub-namespace
{
    internal readonly struct DragIntegrator { … }
}

// VIOLATION:
namespace TacticalDirector.BallPhysics.Simulation { … }
```

---

## CONSTANT CATALOGUES

Every constant lives in `<SpecName>Constants.cs`. No literals in formula or system files (FR-CS-016).

**Naming:** PascalCase folder name + `Constants.cs`

| Spec folder | Catalogue file |
|---|---|
| `ball-physics/` | `BallPhysicsConstants.cs` |
| `agent-movement/` | `AgentMovementConstants.cs` |
| `collision-system/` | `CollisionSystemConstants.cs` |
| *(all specs)* | `<SpecName>Constants.cs` |
| *(cross-spec)* | `project-constants/ProjectConstants.cs` |

**Region order inside every catalogue (most-immutable first):**

```csharp
#region Fixed      // [FIXED]   → public const float BALL_RADIUS = 0.11f;
#region Derived    // [DERIVED] → public static readonly float TerminalVelocity = Mathf.Sqrt(GRAVITY / DRAG_COEFFICIENT);
#region Cross      // [CROSS]   → public static readonly float PhysicsTickHz = ProjectConstants.PHYSICS_TICK_HZ;
#region GT         // [GT]      → public static readonly int MaxSubsteps = 8; // TODO: replace with config loader (Stage 1)
#region EST        // [EST]     → public static readonly float LiftCoefficient = 0.35f; // TODO: validate
```

Omit a region entirely if the spec has no constants with that tag. Empty regions are prohibited.

**Region name convention:** The first three region names use Title Case (`Fixed`, `Derived`, `Cross`). `GT` and `EST` match their tag names exactly since those are already **all-caps abbreviations**. Do not use ALL_CAPS (`FIXED`) or lowercase for region names.

**`[DERIVED]` constants:** The XML doc must include the tag, the formula, and the source constants (FR-CS-021). Substitute actual formula references (FM-NNN, §x.y) from the implementing spec:

```csharp
#region Derived
/// <summary>
/// [DERIVED] Terminal velocity (m/s) at which drag force equals gravity.
/// Formula: sqrt(GRAVITY / DRAG_COEFFICIENT). FM-NNN. Ball Physics #1 §3.x.
/// Source constants: BallPhysicsConstants.GRAVITY, BallPhysicsConstants.DRAG_COEFFICIENT.
/// </summary>
public static readonly float TerminalVelocity =
    Mathf.Sqrt(BallPhysicsConstants.GRAVITY / BallPhysicsConstants.DRAG_COEFFICIENT);
```

**`[GT]` loading mechanism:** The exact class and method for loading `[GT]` constants from tunable config at boot (FR-CS-019) is a Stage 1 deliverable — no class named `ConfigLoader` exists in any approved spec. Until the mechanism is defined and documented in this file, use the constant's design-time default directly and mark it with `// TODO: replace with config loader`:

```csharp
#region GT
/// <summary>[GT] Maximum physics substeps per frame. Code Standards #20 §3.2.3.</summary>
public static readonly int MaxSubsteps = 8; // TODO: replace with config loader (Stage 1)
```

**`[EST]` constants:** Every `[EST]` constant requires a `spec-error-log.md` entry (FR-CS-020). The constant must be promoted to `[GT]`, `[FIXED]`, `[DERIVED]`, or `[CROSS]` before the system that consumes it is implemented. If the validated value is derivable via formula, use `[DERIVED]` (document the formula per FR-CS-021). If it already exists authoritatively in another spec, use `[CROSS]` (cite the authoritative spec and section per FR-CS-022).

**`[CROSS]` mirrors — routing rule (Spec #20 §4.2):**
- **Multi-consumer** (constant used by ≥ 2 spec assemblies): declare in `ProjectConstants.cs`; each consuming catalogue mirrors from there.
- **Single-consumer** (constant used by exactly 1 spec assembly, e.g., a domain tag allocated in Spec #16 §3.4 used only by one spec): the consuming catalogue mirrors directly from the source spec's catalogue — not via `ProjectConstants.cs`.

A `[CROSS]` mirror must not diverge from its source. Naming is PascalCase per §3.2.3. Cite the authoritative spec and section:

```csharp
// Multi-consumer mirror: declare in ProjectConstants.cs; each consuming catalogue mirrors from there.
/// <summary>
/// [CROSS] Physics/render loop tick rate (Hz).
/// Authoritative source: ProjectConstants.cs — PHYSICS_TICK_HZ.
/// Ball Physics #1 §1.2. Value: 60 Hz.
/// </summary>
public static readonly float PhysicsTickHz = ProjectConstants.PHYSICS_TICK_HZ;

// Single-consumer mirror: source spec's catalogue directly, NOT via ProjectConstants.cs
/// <summary>
/// [CROSS] Goalkeeper subsystem domain tag.
/// Authoritative source: DeterministicSimConstants.DOMAIN_TAG_GOALKEEPER.
/// Deterministic Simulation #16 §3.4. Value: 0x1D.
/// </summary>
public static readonly uint DomainTagGoalkeeper =
    DeterministicSimConstants.DOMAIN_TAG_GOALKEEPER;
```

> **Note — naming discrepancy in Spec #20 §4.2 (ERR-020-001, resolved):** The §4.2
> worked example originally showed `PHYSICS_TICK_HZ` (ALL_CAPS) for the `[CROSS]`
> *mirror* field in `BallPhysicsConstants.cs`. This contradicts §3.2.3, which is the
> rule-definition section and states PascalCase for `[CROSS]`. §3.2.3 is authoritative —
> use PascalCase for the mirror field name. Spec #20 §4.2 has been patched to show
> `PhysicsTickHz` (PascalCase). Note that the source constant in `ProjectConstants.cs`
> is tagged `[FIXED]` and correctly uses ALL_CAPS (`PHYSICS_TICK_HZ`); the right-hand
> side of the mirror assignment must reference that ALL_CAPS name.

---

## GAME-LOOP RULES (ZERO ALLOCATION)

The 60 Hz physics/render path must produce **zero managed-memory allocations per frame** (FR-CS-066).

**Required patterns:**
- Game-state data in `readonly struct`, not `class`
- State passed by `ref` parameter
- Pre-allocated fixed-size buffers for temp arrays
- Struct-based events on the event bus (not `event Action<T>`)
- `stackalloc` with `Span<T>` for transient buffers with statically bounded size (C# 7.2+; no `unsafe` block required). The pointer form (`int* p = stackalloc int[n]`) requires `unsafe` and therefore lead-developer sign-off per FR-CS-010 — use the `Span<T>` form by default
- `private static readonly ProfilerMarker` field on every system class for profiling (one-time alloc at startup); call `.Auto()` at each entry point to bracket the measurement scope (FR-CS-070)
- **Dependency injection via constructor parameters** — see "Banned Architectural Patterns" below for the full rule and the four anti-patterns it replaces

**Banned constructs on hot paths (FR-CS-027–034):**
- `new` class objects or managed arrays
- Boxing (value type → object cast)
- LINQ (`.Where`, `.Select`, `.ToList`, etc.)
- `params` array parameters
- String formatting (`$"…"`, `string.Format`, `+` concatenation)
- Closures capturing local variables
- `foreach` over any type that does not expose a concrete struct `GetEnumerator()` at the call site — including `List<T>` or `Dictionary<K,V>` via an interface variable (both `List<T>.Enumerator` and `Dictionary.Enumerator` are structs, but both are boxed when the collection variable is typed as an interface); use arrays or `Span<T>` for hot-path iteration
- Reflection

**Banned language features in game-loop and game-state code (FR-CS-010):**
- `dynamic` — bypasses compile-time type safety; introduces non-deterministic dispatch paths
- `async`/`await` in game-loop / game-state-modifying code — breaks deterministic tick ordering; continuations resume on unpredictable frames. Permitted in initialization code, editor tooling, and loading pipelines that do not touch game state.
- `unsafe` without lead-developer sign-off recorded in the PR description
- `try`/`catch` inside per-frame inner loops (FR-CS-069)
- Virtual method calls inside per-frame inner loops (FR-CS-068)

**Banned architectural patterns in game-state assemblies (FR-CS-051–054):**
- **Service locator** (`ServiceLocator.Get<T>()`) — hides dependencies; breaks deterministic testing
- **Ambient context** (`MatchContext.Current`) — hidden state; breaks replay rewind
- **Static mutable singleton** — cannot be reset between deterministic replay ticks
- **Generic DI container on the hot path** (Zenject, VContainer, `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`) — reflection-based; allocates; violates zero-alloc budget

The required alternative to all four is **constructor injection**: pass dependencies as constructor parameters.

The `ProfilerMarker` field is `private static readonly`, named per the
`s_<EntryPointName>Marker` convention (see "Profiler Markers" section).

```csharp
// COMPLIANT — sealed instance class; dependencies injected via constructor per FR-CS-051–054
// Note: `state with { … }` requires C# 10+ on readonly structs. Verify the
// Unity LTS + backend in certification-platform.md before using this pattern.
public sealed class BallPhysicsSystem
{
    private readonly MatchClock _clock;
    private static readonly ProfilerMarker s_updateMarker =
        new ProfilerMarker("BallPhysics.Update");

    public BallPhysicsSystem(MatchClock clock)
    {
        _clock = clock;
    }

    public void Update(ref BallState state, float dt)
    {
        using var _ = s_updateMarker.Auto();
        state = state with { Velocity = state.Velocity * (1f - BallPhysicsConstants.DRAG_COEFFICIENT * dt) };
    }
}

// VIOLATION — copies BallState by value; wastes memory bandwidth
public void Update(BallState state, float dt) { … }
```

---

## DETERMINISM RULES

No `System.Random`, no `DateTime.Now`, no `Guid.NewGuid()`, no `Task.Run` or `Parallel.*`, no hardware-intrinsic FMA in game logic (FR-CS-036–040).

| Need | Use | Owning assembly |
|---|---|---|
| Random numbers | `SplitMix64` helper (FR-CS-041) | `deterministic-sim/` (Spec #16) |
| Simulation time | `MatchClock` (injected) (FR-CS-042) | `deterministic-sim/` (Spec #16) |
| Trigonometry / math | Project math helper (FR-CS-043) | `project-constants/` — exact class TBD at Stage 1 |
| Deterministic IDs | Pre-allocated deterministic ID ranges (Spec #16 §3.2.5) | `deterministic-sim/` (Spec #16) |

**Hardware-intrinsic FMA (FR-CS-040):** Fused multiply-add instructions can produce different results from separate multiply + add on different hardware or compiler versions. FMA intrinsics are banned unless the platform is pinned and the lead developer has signed off.

**64-bit multiplication** must use `unchecked { }` with a `// Spec #16 §3.4.4` comment
(FR-CS-044), regardless of which assembly the code lives in. The citation always refers
to Spec #16 §3.4.4 (SplitMix64 state update) — not the local spec's §3.4.4:

```csharp
unchecked  // Spec #16 §3.4.4: deliberate 64-bit wrap-around; not an overflow bug
{
    state += 0x9E3779B97F4A7C15UL;
}
```

**Python tooling** that mirrors C# SplitMix64 constants (FR-CS-045): omit the `UL` suffix and mask intermediates with `& 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`. Do not mix `unchecked` into Python (it has no meaning there) or mask operators into C# (that would introduce a different semantic).

---

## NUMERIC TYPES

- `float` everywhere at Stage 0 (FR-CS-071).
- `double` is banned by default; override requires lead-developer sign-off and inline comment.
- `decimal` is always banned.
- Fixed64 migration is a Stage 5+ concern (Spec #9).

---

## INTERFACE DESIGN

Write an interface only when both the producer and consumer are specified. No phantom interfaces for unspecified systems (ERR-001, ERR-004, FR-CS-048/049).

An `interface` file MUST reside in the same assembly as at least one of its specified consumers (FR-CS-048). Access modifier is `public` only if callers cross the assembly boundary; `internal` otherwise (FR-CS-015).

**Event-vs-interface decision tree (FR-CS-050):**
- Same assembly → direct method call
- Cross-assembly, consumer not yet specified → wait; create nothing
- Cross-assembly, consumer specified, multiple implementations → interface (in consumer's assembly)
- Cross-assembly, single implementation, lower→higher layer notification → struct event on event bus
- Cross-assembly, single implementation, same or downward layer → direct method call

## FILE HEADER (REQUIRED ON EVERY FILE)

```csharp
// File:     src/ball-physics/BallPhysicsCore.cs
// Created:  2026-05-19
// Modified: 2026-05-19

**Required fields (FR-CS-056/057):** file path (relative to repo root), created date (ISO), modified date (must match latest version-history row), author, governing specs, purpose (≤ 2 sentences).

Version history lives at the end of the file; rows are appended, never deleted.

When a file is authored or modified by an automated agent with no named individual, use `—` in the Author field.

---

## XML DOC COMMENTS

Every `public` type, method, property, and event requires `/// <summary>`. Every constant (any access level) requires `/// <summary>` that includes its tag (FR-CS-060/061).

```csharp
/// <summary>[FIXED] Ball radius in metres. Ball Physics Spec #1 §2.1.</summary>
public const float BALL_RADIUS = 0.11f;

/// <summary>Applies drag to ball velocity for one physics step.</summary>
/// <param name="velocity">Current velocity vector (m/s).</param>
/// <param name="dt">Time delta in seconds.</param>
public static Vector3 CalculateDrag(Vector3 velocity, float dt) { … }
```

---

## INLINE COMMENTS

Write a comment only when the **why** is non-obvious. Do not comment what the code already says (FR-CS-064).

```csharp
// COMPLIANT — hidden constraint
unchecked  // Spec #16 §3.4.4: deliberate 64-bit wrap-around; not an overflow bug
{ … }

// VIOLATION — states the obvious
int count = agentList.Count;  // Get the number of agents
```

**Commented-out code is prohibited** in any commit to a shared branch (FR-CS-065). Delete disabled code; version control preserves the history.

---

## `using` DIRECTIVE ORDER

System → Unity → Project, each group separated by a blank line (FR-CS-006):

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Profiling;

using TacticalDirector.BallPhysics;
using TacticalDirector.EventSystem;
```

Alphabetical within each group is recommended but not enforced.

---

## PROFILER MARKERS

Every system entry point (`Update`, `Tick`, `RunStep`, or similarly named method) must be wrapped in a `ProfilerMarker.Auto()`. The marker is a `private static readonly` field (allocated once at startup — zero per-frame cost) (FR-CS-070).

> **Note:** These are custom methods on game system classes — **not** Unity MonoBehaviour
> lifecycle callbacks (`FixedUpdate()` / `Update()` with no parameters). The MonoBehaviour
> / PlayerLoop integration layer is a Stage 1 concern; see "WHAT IS NOT HERE YET" below.

**Field naming convention:** `s_<EntryPointName>Marker` — e.g., `s_updateMarker` for `Update`, `s_runTickMarker` for `RunTick`.

**Marker string format:** `<SpecName>.<MethodName>` (e.g., `"BallPhysics.Update"`, `"DeterministicSim.RunTick"`).

```csharp
using UnityEngine.Profiling;

// Profiler-relevant fields shown; constructor and injected dependencies
// follow the same pattern as the Game-Loop Rules COMPLIANT example above.
public sealed class BallPhysicsSystem
{
    private static readonly ProfilerMarker s_updateMarker =
        new ProfilerMarker("BallPhysics.Update");

    public void Update(ref BallState state, float dt)
    {
        using var _ = s_updateMarker.Auto();
        // …
    }
}
```

## STAGE 0 VERIFICATION

No static analysis tooling yet. Verify each file manually against the Spec #20 §5.4 checklist before marking it complete. Roslyn analyzers, `BannedSymbols.txt`, and `.editorconfig` activate at Stage 1 once `certification-platform.md` is fully pinned.

## WHAT IS NOT HERE YET

These items are deferred pending Unity project setup and platform pinning:

| Item | Blocked on |
|---|---|
| `.asmdef` content (GUIDs, `allowUnsafeCode`, `autoReferenced`, `testPlatforms`, `versionDefines`) | Unity project initialization |
| Exact Unity LTS revision | `docs/tracking/certification-platform.md` pinned |
| `dotnet test` framework args | Stage 0+1 setup (Spec #19 §7.5 D2 — framework pin deferred to Stage 0+1) |
| Unity batch-mode CI commands | Unity project initialization |
| `.editorconfig` path and contents | Stage 1 setup |
| C# language version pin | `certification-platform.md` pinned |
| `[GT]` config loader class / method | Stage 1 setup — define in this file when resolved; update all `// TODO: replace with config loader` constants |
| Project math helper class name / assembly | Stage 1 setup — update determinism table when defined |
| MonoBehaviour / PlayerLoop integration pattern | Unity project initialization — how Unity's lifecycle loop calls into struct-based game systems; until defined, system entry points are pure C# instance methods named `Update`, `Tick`, or similar |

Update this file when those items are resolved.

M-1: s_fixedUpdateMarker declaration added to game-loop example; field naming convention added. M-2: [CROSS] mirror RHS corrected to ProjectConstants.PHYSICS_TICK_HZ (ALL_CAPS). M-3: tree comment for ProjectConstants.cs: wrong tag and scope fixed. M-4: single vs multi-consumer [CROSS] routing rule documented. M-5: C# 10+ note added to `with {}` example. M-6: infrastructure assembly table added to taxonomy section. M-7: .asmdef coverage note added under tree. L-1: Last Updated header field added. L-2: ProfilerMarker field naming rule added. L-3: `using UnityEngine.Profiling;` added to profiler example. L-4: var policy semicolon fixed. L-5: owning assembly column added to determinism table. L-6: BallCollision.cs vs collision-system/ note added to tree. L-7: [CROSS] XML doc updated to cite spec+section. L-8: foreach ban reworded for technical accuracy. |
| 1.3 | 2026-05-19 | — | Adversarial review v1.2 fix pass (2H · 5M · 4L). H-1: project-constants diagram line fixed; removed broken ← arrow (RHS was prose). H-2: // §3.4.4 → // Spec #16 §3.4.4 in Determinism Rules and Inline Comments sections. M-1: Physics→AI prohibition rewritten in prose (inconsistent arrow direction). M-2: async/await entry scoped to "game-loop / game-state-modifying"; heading updated to match. M-3: tests/ .asmdef entries added to all five expanded spec folders; .asmdef coverage note extended with test-assembly rule. M-4: foreach parenthetical covers both List<T>.Enumerator and Dictionary.Enumerator. M-5: [GT] region comment updated to match actual code pattern (= 8; // TODO:). L-1: — author placeholder documented in File Header section. L-2: .asmdef deferral entry expanded to all unresolved fields. L-3: DI bullet in required-patterns replaced with cross-reference to Banned Architectural Patterns section. L-4: ProfilerMarker naming comment moved outside game-loop code block. |
| 1.4 | 2026-05-22 | — | Adversarial review v1.3 fix pass (1H · 4M · 3L). H-1: Game-Loop COMPLIANT example rewritten as sealed instance class (public void); VIOLATION updated to match. M-1: [EST] promotion targets extended to [GT] / [FIXED] / [DERIVED] / [CROSS] with guidance for each path. M-2: Profiler Markers entry-point list changed from FixedUpdate/Update to Update/Tick/RunStep; MonoBehaviour-not-applicable note added; examples updated (FixedUpdate → Update, s_fixedUpdateMarker → s_updateMarker); WHAT IS NOT HERE YET row added for MonoBehaviour/PlayerLoop integration. M-3: Naming discrepancy note updated with ERR-020-001 reference and confirmation that §4.2 has been patched. M-4: stackalloc Span<T> vs pointer distinction added. L-1: §3.2 → §3.2.3 in [GT] XML doc. L-2: [DERIVED] worked example added; region comment shows formula instead of ellipsis. L-3: #region name convention (Title Case vs acronym) documented. |
| 1.5 | 2026-05-22 | — | Adversarial review v1.4 fix pass (1H · 1M · 5L). H-1+M-1 (combined): Game-Loop COMPLIANT example rewritten to show constructor injection (_clock field + constructor body); method renamed Update, field renamed s_updateMarker, profiler string "BallPhysics.Update"; VIOLATION moved inside class as commented-out method. L-1: "two-letter acronyms" → "all-caps abbreviations" (EST has 3 letters). L-2: VIOLATION was orphaned outside class at file scope (invalid C#); now inside BallPhysicsSystem as commented-out member. L-3: Root CLAUDE.md "Heartbeat Tick Rate" removed from [CROSS] XML doc example (non-spec citation); Ball Physics #1 §1.2 alone is sufficient. L-4: ProfilerMarker required-patterns bullet rewritten to distinguish the field declaration (one-time alloc) from the .Auto() call at entry points. L-5: Single-consumer [CROSS] mirror example added alongside multi-consumer example. |
| 1.6 | 2026-05-22 | — | Adversarial review v1.5 fix pass (0H · 1M · 2L). M-1: Profiler Markers BallPhysicsSystem example gained a note "Profiler-relevant fields shown; constructor and injected dependencies follow Game-Loop Rules COMPLIANT example." L-1: commented-out VIOLATION removed from inside COMPLIANT class body (violated FR-CS-065); restored as standalone labeled snippet outside the class. L-2: private static field naming convention (s_camelCase) added to NAMING CONVENTIONS table. |
