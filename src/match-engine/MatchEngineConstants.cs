// Spec:     Match Engine design note (docs/tracking/match-engine-design.md) §2.3, Code Standards #20
// Purpose:  Constant catalogue for the match-engine composition root. Stage 0 Phase A holds the
//           roster sizing, the coordinate convention (Ball Physics #1 §1.2 corner-origin, Z-up),
//           and the Phase-A snapshot payload format version. Real formation slots are sourced from
//           PositioningAIConstants when the AI phase is wired (Phase D); the Phase-A kickoff line
//           positions are scaffold values derived from pitch geometry only.
